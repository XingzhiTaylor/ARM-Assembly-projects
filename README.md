# ARM-Assembly-projects
These lab projects are prepared for the course ECE 222 --- Digital Computers. The programs are developed and debugged using Keil Î¼Vision4 IDE, and tested on ARM MCB1700 board with LPC1768 microcontroller unit. There are four labs included in this course.

Lab 1: Flashing LED

Objective: Complete, assemble, and download a simple assembly language program.

What to do:

Write some THUMB assembly language instructions
Use different memory addressing modes
Test and debug code on ARM board
Use on-board RAM instead of Flash memory
Flash LED (Light Emitting Diode) at approximately 1 Hz frequency

Lab 2: Subroutines and Parameter Passing

Objective: Practice subroutine calling and parameter passing by implementing a Morse code system.

What to do:

Turn one LED into a Morse code transmitter that blinks in Morse code for a five character word
Implement subroutines LED_ON (turn LED on), LED_OFF (turn LED off), DELAY (takes parameter Rn and delays for Rn*500 ms), CHAR2MORSE (converts characters to Morse by using a Morse LUT)

Lab 3: Input/Output Interfacing

Objective: Learn how to use peripherals connected to a microprocessor by setting up and using Input/Output ports.

What to do:

Implement reflex meter to measure user response to event accurate to one tenth of a millisecond
Initally all LEDs are off, one LED turns on after a random amount of time (2-10 seconds)
Counter increments after LED turns on and before user presses input button
Use polling method to determine when input button is pressed
32 bit number representing response time sent to 8 LEDs in seperate bytes with 2s delay between each group
Demo:

Simple counter that increments indefinitely from 0x00 to 0xFF to demonstrate correct manipulation and handling of bits
Reflex meter

Lab 4: Interrupt Handling

Objective: Learn about interrupts and trigger interrupt service routine.

What to do:

Implement reflex meter from Lab 3 with an interrupt instead of polling

In this repository, I uploaded only the .s files since those are the only files I worked on. The other required files to run the program on the board are automatically generated by the IDE.
